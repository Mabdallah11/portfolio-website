	<h1>About myself</h1>

	<div>
		<p>i tend to overthink such a question leading me to repeat the same answer i have been producing for the last few years except each year comes with am addition of values to the past.I suppose names would be the cliche thing to start with as suppose to telling you my favourite colour food and drink in addition to that we have a segment for my hobbies and school life but that has its own page , so names favorite color seems to be our focal point. i go by the name Mac and i can assure you formatting this website came with a lot of thought</p>
		<p>
		one of the major things about making a website to me would be funtionality and overall aesthetic , something responsive that would make people jump right back into your site even after visiting twice already.i have to be honest its hard and faces a lot of judgement which i do take serioulsy. The aspect of meeting many user requirements in a website can be really motivating.One of th e first website i ever made really had close to no functionality though it was really more of a learning phase.</p>
